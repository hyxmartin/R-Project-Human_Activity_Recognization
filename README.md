# Human Activity Recognization
There are tons of companies and numerous applications working on this subject. The dataset can be collected through sensors like accelerometers as well as devices that we are using everyday like cell phones, watches, glasses. We can totally image that human activity recognition and related technology will appear everywhere in the near future. Together with other technology like nature language process, any product will have a capability to understand human voice and activity and make proper response. 

Tasks in this practise:
Understand the dataset
Determine if activities can be correctly detected by the raw features provided.
Determine if derived features can be used and what these derived features are. Again, determine if activities can be correctly detected with these new features
Investigate how long it takes to detect a change from one type of activity to another
Determine which location waist, left thigh, right arm, or right ankle results in the best activity classifier in terms of both classification accuracy and change point detection.
Summarize findings.
